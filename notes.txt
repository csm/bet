Some notes on this project, in its early days.

This is an attempt to write something similar to aleph, but using core.async
as the asynchronous library instead of manifold. Also, add some more features
that are missing from aleph (such as HTTP/2).

Aleph is a wonderful toolkit for using Netty from Clojure, and it gives you
an excellent common case to work from, simplifying Netty greatly. Having used
both core.async and manifold in production systems, though, I greatly prefer
the former. Manifold just doesn't feel like a good, clojurey way of doing
things, and it unfortunately still has some bugs that have been hard to work
around.

I'm going to steal liberally from Aleph if there are things I need from it,
because a lot of the work in Aleph is already excellent.
